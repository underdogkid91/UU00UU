UU00UU is a collection of webtoys with the objective of learning and
exploring interactive graphic 3d visuals.

## stack and source
all the code is open source and available in github. the site is built
with jekyll and the webtoys with dimensions.js, my own framework on top
of three.js

## updates and contact
you can subscribe to the UU00UU newsletter to recieibe emails only when
there's a new webtoy (which is not that often).

you can contact me to talk about three.js, 3d, digital, music, life or
whatever you feel like. also i'm open to collaborating with other
artists (musicians, 3d artists, web makers...). my email is
underdogkidkid at gmail dot com.
