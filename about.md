UU00UU is a collection of webtoys with the objective of learning and
exploring interactive graphic 3d visuals.

## style and subjects of interest
my style is inspired by low poly games. i don't use lights, instead
i use colorful colorful textures, usually featuring gradients.

at the moment i don't work with characters, but mostly with abstract
shapes and objects. i'm interested in bringing them to live using
interesting compositions, morphing, and visual effects (mostly using
particles).

finally, i always try to add some kind of interaction. i'm mostly
attracted by intuitive ones, so the user discover something unexpected
without the need of explanation.


## updates and contact
you can subscribe to the UU00UU newsletter to recieibe emails only when
there's a new webtoy (which is not that often).

you can contact me to talk about three.js, 3d, digital, music, life or
whatever you feel like. also i'm open to collaborating with other
artists (musicians, 3d artists, web makers...). my email is
underdogkidkid at gmail dot com.
